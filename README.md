# UN Datathon - Hackalyze

Welcome to the **UN Datathon - Hackalyze** repository! This project was created for a data analysis hackathon organized by United Nations. It includes data preparation, analysis, and visualization tools for discovering insights from publicly available datasets. The main goal is to leverage data to provide actionable insights on relevant social, economic, and environmental topics.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis produced for the **UN Datathon**. Our objective is to uncover trends and insights using datasets related to topics such as:
- Socioeconomic indicators
- Environmental impact
- Public health
- Tourism

Using data science and machine learning tools, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of these issues and present our findings through data visualizations.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this project are either open-source or provided by the event organizers. They include:
- Social and economic data
- Environmental datasets
- Public health data

Each dataset is available in the `data/` folder or through online repositories specified in the project.

## Requirements

To replicate the analysis and run the scripts in this repository, you'll need:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Common data science libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for running `.ipynb` files)

You can install all requirements using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine and install the necessary packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmramirez1204/un-datathon-hackalyze.git
cd un-datathon-hackalyze
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can explore the analysis by running the Jupyter notebooks available in the `notebooks/` folder. The main steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore patterns and trends.
3. **Modeling (optional)**: Use machine learning models to make predictions or classify data.
4. **Visualization**: Generate charts and visualizations to summarize findings.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
